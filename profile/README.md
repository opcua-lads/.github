## Hi there 👋  - A warm welcome to OPC UA LADS - the "Laboratory & Analytical Device Standard" built on OPC UA
<b>Browse the standard: https://reference.opcfoundation.org/LADS/v100/docs/</b>
## 

We want to help you get started and enable you to enter the strong foundations of the OPC UA ecosystem for your laboratory/analytical devices.

#
<h2>1. Learn about OPC UA</h2>
As a first step we want to encourage you to learn more about OPC UA, so it becomes even cleare why we chose to create LADS upon this strong foundation:

<h2>2. Learn about the concepts of OPC UA LADS</h2>
If you directly want to dive into OPC UA LADS, we can recommend recorded talks by Dr. Matthias Arnold, the lead author of OPC UA LADS 30500:

#
<h2>3. Create a OPC UA LADS device</h2>
If you are all prepared with the theory, then you may want to get started with our workshop example:
https://github.com/opcua-lads/workshop

The workshop provides a complete device model and a server utilizing nodejs/ts.

Soon we will link additional exmaples to use the workshop device model also with prominent stacks for C/C++ and C#

#
<h2>4. Helpful tools for OPC UA LADS</h2>
